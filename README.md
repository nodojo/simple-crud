# Coding Challenge

### Coding Challenge Requirements

- Create a simple CRUD app (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)
- You may pick any tool you choose but we recommend Scala (Akka Http), Javascript/Typescript (Express), Go(mux), or ASP.NET Core. (Bonus points if you use Scala!)
- You must write at least one unit test per CRUD operation
- When completed, push your project to GitHub or Gitlab and reply with a link to the repository
